            <br>
            <p class="bio">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
                scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
                decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
                civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as <span
                    style="font-style: oblique; font-size: larger; color: burlywood;"> "The Missile Man of India"
                </span> for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also
                played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
                1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the <span
                    style="font-style: oblique; font-size: larger; color: burlywood;">"People's President"</span>, he
                returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
                recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
                attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
                honours.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Early Life and Education</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="bio">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Sunni Tamil Muslim
                family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in
                the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local
                mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back
                and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four
                brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners,
                with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal
                Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had
                involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as
                ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland
                in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s,
                apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young
                boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. <br>In his school years, Kalam had
                average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn.
                He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After completing his education at the Schwartz
                Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College,
                Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in
                1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While
                Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
                threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam
                met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking
                you to meet a difficult deadline."He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as
                he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-center">Career As a Scientist</h3>
            <p class="bio">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the
                Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press
                Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research
                & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai,
                the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first
                Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the
                Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite
                Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July
                1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In
                1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
                <br>In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space
                Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam
                made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which
                proved to be successful. <br>Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear
                test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its
                development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which
                sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the
                disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace
                projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role
                convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His
                research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted
                the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S
                Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by
                the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of
                missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting
                the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile
                Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in
                developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and
                Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for
                mismanagement and cost and time overruns. <br>Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime
                Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December
                1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive
                political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala
                Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's
                best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the
                thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam
                and Chidambaram dismissed the claims. <br>In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a
                low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet
                computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".
